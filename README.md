## Data Sets

### Data Set: Airfoil Self-Noise From UCI Machine Learning Repository

#### Source:

#### Creators: 
Thomas F. Brooks, D. Stuart Pope and Michael A. Marcolini 
NASA


#### Data Set Information:

The NASA data set comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack. The span of the airfoil and the observer position were the same in all of the experiments.


#### Attribute Information:

This problem has the following inputs: 
1. Frequency, in Hertzs. 
2. Angle of attack, in degrees. 
3. Chord length, in meters. 
4. Free-stream velocity, in meters per second. 
5. Suction side displacement thickness, in meters. 

The only output is:

6. Scaled sound pressure level, in decibels.

### Data Set: Iris From UCI Machine Learning Repository

#### Source:

Creator: 

R.A. Fisher 

Donor: 

Michael Marshall (MARSHALL%PLU '@' io.arc.nasa.gov)


#### Data Set Information:

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. 

Predicted attribute: class of iris plant. 

This is an exceedingly simple domain. 

This data differs from the data presented in Fishers article (identified by Steve Chadwick, spchadwick '@' espeedaz.net ). The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,"Iris-setosa" where the error is in the fourth feature. The 38th sample: 4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,"Iris-setosa" where the errors are in the second and third features.


#### Attribute Information:

1. sepal length in cm 
2. sepal width in cm 
3. petal length in cm 
4. petal width in cm 
5. class: 
-- Iris Setosa 
-- Iris Versicolour 
-- Iris Virginica
